This graph highlights variations depending on regional energy sources by comparing the lifetime CO2 emissions of gasoline and electric cars (EVs) in the US, Europe, and China. Over their lifetime, EVs in the US release about 30 metric tons of CO₂, which is almost 60% less than that of gasoline-powered vehicles, which emit 75 metric tons. With its vast array of renewable energy sources, Europe exhibits even larger reductions; EVs emit 21 metric tons, compared to 67 for gasoline-powered vehicles, a 69% decrease. In China, where coal is still a significant source of electricity, EVs generate roughly 40 metric tons, a 37% difference from gasoline's 63 metric tons. Similarly, EVs in India emit about 50 metric tons, while gasoline-powered vehicles emit 62 metric tons, a smaller 19% decrease as a result of the significant use of fossil fuels. In general, EVs emit far fewer pollutants than gasoline-powered vehicles, particularly in areas with cleaner electrical grids. This highlights the significance of renewable energy in optimizing the environmental advantages of EVs.

# Environmental Impacts of Nickel Mining

Significant environmental effects have resulted from the growing demand for nickel in electric vehicle (EV) batteries, particularly in Indonesia, which has some of the greatest nickel reserves in the world. In order to make room for mining facilities like the Indonesia Weda Bay Industrial Park (IWIP), forests that are essential for storing carbon are being extensively cleared—more than 5,331 hectares on Halmahera Island alone. In addition to releasing carbon dioxide, this deforestation disturbs ecosystems. In addition, nickel mining operations pollute adjacent rivers, tainting water supplies that are vital to the populations that depend on them. In addition to the coal-fired power plants at IWIP producing 3.78 gigawatts yearly, which further contributes to local air pollution and has an adverse effect on the health of local residents, fishermen in the vicinity complain that filthy water has forced them farther out to sea in search of uncontaminated fish.

# Relative Environmental Impact of Water and Air Pollution from Nickel Mining

The distribution of air and water pollution brought on by nickel mining for electric vehicle (EV) batteries is depicted in the pie chart. The graphic makes use of projected impact levels of 4,000 for water pollution and 5,000 for air pollution, which are based on qualitative data from impacted communities in Indonesia. The section on water pollution, which is highlighted in light blue, shows how the Indonesia Weda Bay Industrial Park (IWIP) has contaminated nearby rivers, affecting drinking water and upsetting local fishers. The section on air pollution, highlighted in yellow-green, focuses on the environmental and health risks associated with five coal-fired power plants that serve IWIP operations. These emissions have an impact on the quality of the air and cause respiratory problems in neighboring villages. When taken as a whole, these figures demonstrate the extent of pollution as a significant environmental expense tied to nickel production, underscoring the enigma of mining activities intended to support “green” EV technology.

# Cost of Nickel Throughout the Years

The extraction process of nickel uses a lot of energy, disturbs ecosystems, and generates a lot of trash, the price of nickel is directly related to the environmental effects of nickel mining. Demand is increasing as the transition to sustainable energy quickens since nickel is a crucial component of batteries, particularly for electric vehicles (EVs). However, nickel mining and processing require a lot of resources and release harmful pollutants and greenhouse gases that contaminate the soil, water, and air. The economic cost of producing nickel includes these environmental costs, as well as additional costs for sustainability initiatives, cleanup, and regulatory compliance. The nickel industry is under pressure to implement environmentally friendly mining methods as society demands cleaner technologies. While doing so may result in higher production costs, it may also lessen long-term ecological harm.
