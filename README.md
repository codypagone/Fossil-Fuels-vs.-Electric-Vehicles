Significant environmental effects have resulted from the growing demand for nickel in electric vehicle (EV) batteries, particularly in Indonesia, which has some of the greatest nickel reserves in the world. In order to make room for mining facilities like the Indonesia Weda Bay Industrial Park (IWIP), forests that are essential for storing carbon are being extensively clearedâ€”more than 5,331 hectares on Halmahera Island alone. In addition to releasing carbon dioxide, this deforestation disturbs ecosystems. In addition, nickel mining operations pollute adjacent rivers, tainting water supplies that are vital to the populations that depend on them. In addition to the coal-fired power plants at IWIP producing 3.78 gigawatts yearly, which further contributes to local air pollution and has an adverse effect on the health of local residents, fishermen in the vicinity complain that filthy water has forced them farther out to sea in search of uncontaminated fish.
